Each login, account or dossier we use or is used on our behalf is part of an attack surface. The following (or preceeding) is information toward to lessening the points of attack on our personal and collective information security.

[Social Engineering](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/social-engineering?s=t), as it relates to information security, is defined by dictionary.com as an attack with an aim to trick people into revealing passwords or other information that compromises a target systemâ€™s security.

Related to social engineering-based attacks are vulnerabilities caused when we share personally identifiable information about ourselves, our colleagues or our institutionally unprompted.
These leaks in the workplace can unintentionally lead to cyber-attacks not only on your office but to your coworkers.

Please remember the following safety tips:

  * Be sparing with group e-mail. Group e-mail should only be utilized when the information is useful to all recipients of that group.
  * Only use "Reply All" when each person who received the original message will need to be aware of your correspondence.
  * Do not send **personally identifiable information**. This information includes: Full Name, Home Address, Social Security Number, Date of Birth, Drivers license number, Passport number, National identification number, IP address, Vehicle registration plate, Face, Fingerprints, handwriting, Credit Card numbers, Digital identity, Birthplace, Genetic information, Login name, nicknames, etc. Sharing this information often leads to identity theft.
  * Refrain from forwarding hoaxes and spam. Sharing these types of e-mail can lead to viruses being introduced to the campus.
  * Do not attach unnecessary files. Sending unnecessary attachments can slow down the e-mail system and cannot be easily be recalled.

Please make sure your password or password recovery information (security question, date of birth, etc.) does not contain any of your own personally indentifiable information. Keeping these safety tips in mind will assist us in maintaining a safe e-mail environment for faculty, staff, and students.
